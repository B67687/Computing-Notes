A **multiplexer** (MUX) is a digital logic device that selects **one input from many** and routes it to a **single output**, based on control signal called a **selector**

The multiplexer itself can be **thought of as a "selector"**, although the one that actually selects the output is **within the multiplexer**

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph Inputs
    I0["I₀"]
    I1["I₁"]
    I2["I₂"]
  end

  subgraph Select Lines
    S0["S₀"]
    S1["S₁"]
  end

  subgraph Multiplexer
    MUX["MUX (4-to-1)"]
  end

  subgraph Output
    Y["Output Y"]
  end

  I0 --> MUX
  I1 --> MUX
  I2 --> MUX
  S0 --> MUX
  S1 --> MUX
  MUX --> Y
```

> [!info]
> - **Inputs:** $n$ binary signals
> - **Output:** 1


> [!example] Notes
> MUX is often called a **data selector**.
> 
> Can be built using logic gates or hierarchical MUX trees.
> 
> In programming, MUX behavior resembles a **switch-case** or **if-else chain**
