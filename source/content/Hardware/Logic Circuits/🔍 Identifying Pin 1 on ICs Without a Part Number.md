Even if the printed part number is faded, you can still identify Pin 1 using these physical markers:

### 🟡 1. Dot or Dimple

- A small **circular indentation** near one corner of the chip.
- Pin 1 is directly adjacent to the dot.
- Common on DIP, SOIC, and QFP packages.

### 🟪 2. Notch or Half-Moon

- A **groove or notch** on one end of the IC.
- When facing the notch, Pin 1 is at the **lower-left corner**.
- Standard for DIP and some QFP packages.

### 🔺 3. Beveled or Chamfered Edge

- One edge of the chip is **angled or slanted**.
- When the bevel is at the bottom, Pin 1 is at the **lower-left corner**.

### 🟥 4. Stripe or Band

- A **colored or molded stripe** across one end of the chip.
- Pin 1 is at the **bottom-left corner** when the stripe is on the left.

### 🔳 5. Square Pad (on PCB or QFN/BGA)

- On surface-mount packages, Pin 1 may be marked by a **square pad** or **larger solder ball**.
- Especially useful for QFN and BGA packages.

### 🔤 6. Text Orientation

- If the part number is still readable:
  - Orient the chip so the text is upright.
  - Pin 1 is usually at the **lower-left corner** of the text block.

### 📐 7. Triangle or Arrow

- Some chips have a **small triangle** pointing to Pin 1.
- Found on opto-isolators and some analog ICs.
