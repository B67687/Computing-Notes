Diodes are built from PN junctionsâ€”where [[âš¡Semiconductor Doping| N-type and P-type semiconductors]] meet.

Understanding **which way current flows**, and **why semiconductors are used** instead of charged materials, is key to mastering electronics and abstraction-layer clarity.

## ðŸ”Œ Direction of Current in a PN Junction

| Perspective         | Direction of Flow       | Carriers Involved         |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Conventional Current** | P â†’ N (positive to negative) | Imaginary positive flow     |
| **Electron Flow**        | N â†’ P (electrons move)       | Actual physical electrons   |

- **Conventional current** assumes current flows from **positive to negative**â€”this is used in most circuit diagrams.
- **Electron flow** is the actual movement of **electrons**, which go from **N-type (electron-rich)** to **P-type (hole-rich)**.

> ðŸ§  In forward bias, electrons from the N-side recombine with holes on the P-side, allowing current to flow.

## âš¡ Why Use Semiconductors Instead of Charged Materials?

- **Charged materials** (like ions or static charges) donâ€™t allow **controlled, directional flow**â€”theyâ€™re either fixed or chaotic.
- You need a **dynamic medium** where charge carriers can move **under voltage control**.
- Semiconductors offer:
  - **Tunable conductivity** via doping
  - **Directional behavior** via junctions
  - **Switching and amplification** via transistors
  - **Stable lattice structure** for fabrication

### âœ… What Semiconductors Enable

- Formation of **depletion regions** and **built-in electric fields**
- Controlled **forward and reverse bias behavior**
- Integration into **logic gates**, **amplifiers**, and **digital ICs**
- Scalability for **CMOS**, **RF**, and **power electronics**
