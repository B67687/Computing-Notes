## 🧠 Motivation

> [!Why we care]
> Semiconductors like silicon are **not naturally conductive**—they have:
> - A **bandgap** that blocks free movement of electrons
> - Very few thermally generated carriers at room temperature
>
> 👉 To make silicon useful in electronics, we must **increase the number of mobile charge carriers**:
> - **Electrons** (negative carriers)
> - **Holes** (positive carriers—missing electrons in bonds)

## 🧱 Bonding Logic: How Doping Creates Carriers

### 🧬 Silicon's Native Structure
- Each silicon atom has **4 valence electrons**
- Forms **4 covalent bonds** in a tetrahedral lattice
- All electrons are **locked in bonds**, so few are free to conduct

### 🧩 Doping: Substitution Creates Imbalance
We replace some silicon atoms with dopants:
- **Pentavalent atoms (5 valence electrons)** → donate an extra electron → **n-type**
- **Trivalent atoms (3 valence electrons)** → leave a bond unfilled → **hole → p-type**

### 🎲 Physical Analogy
- Think of silicon as a **Lego grid** with 4 pegs per atom
- A pentavalent atom has **5 pegs**—1 extra peg becomes a free electron
- A trivalent atom has **3 pegs**—1 bond is missing, creating a hole

## 🧪 Energy Level Intuition

### 🪜 Shallow Donors and Acceptors
- Pentavalent dopants introduce energy levels **just below the conduction band**
- Trivalent dopants introduce levels **just above the valence band**
- These are **easy to ionize** at room temperature → free carriers

### 🧠 Analogy: Bandgap as a Staircase
- Conduction band = top floor
- Valence band = ground floor
- Dopant levels = steps near each floor → easier to climb

## 🧭 Doping Properties: What Makes It Work?

Doping works best when:
- ✅ Dopant atom is **similar in size** to silicon → minimal lattice distortion
- ✅ Dopant forms **stable covalent bonds**
- ✅ Introduced energy levels are **shallow** → easy carrier release
- ✅ Doping concentration is **moderate** → avoids recombination or metallic behavior

## 🧯 Carrier Types — n-type and p-type

Doping creates two types of semiconductors based on the **dominant mobile charge carrier**:

> **n-type** 
> → dopant donates electrons 
> → electrons are majority carriers 
>
> **p-type** 
> → dopant creates holes 
> → holes are majority carriers 


### ⚠️ Edge Cases
- Over-doping → too many carriers → scattering, recombination
- Wrong size dopant → lattice strain → defects
- Deep energy levels → carriers trapped → ineffective doping

## 🧬 Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Semiconductors

Adding dopants transforms the nature of the semiconductor:

> **Intrinsic** → pure semiconductor (e.g. undoped silicon) 
> 
> **Extrinsic** → doped semiconductor with added elements 

Intrinsic carriers are thermally generated 
→ **low concentration**

Extrinsic carriers come from dopants 
→ **high, controllable concentration**

Doping shifts the Fermi level 
→ toward **conduction band (n-type)**
→ toward **valence band (p-type)**

## 🧊 Why Silicon? Why Phosphorus and Boron?

### 🧼 Silicon's Appeal
- Abundant, stable, moderate bandgap (~1.1 eV)
- Excellent thermal and mechanical properties
- Forms clean tetrahedral lattice

### ✅ Phosphorus (n-type)
- 5 valence electrons → donates 1 free electron
- Atomic radius close to silicon
- Shallow donor level (~0.045 eV below conduction band)
- Stable, safe, widely available

### ✅ Boron (p-type)
- 3 valence electrons → creates 1 hole
- Very small atom → fits well into lattice
- Shallow acceptor level (~0.045 eV above valence band)
- Chemically stable, abundant

### 🧪 Alternatives (Less Common)
| Dopant | Type | Downsides |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Arsenic | n-type | Heavier, toxic |
| Antimony | n-type | Larger, more strain |
| Aluminum | p-type | Larger, less stable |
| Gallium | p-type | Less common, more expensive |
