## 🧠 What a Compiler Does
A compiler translates **human‑readable source code** into **machine code** that the CPU can execute.  
Different strategies decide **when** and **how** this translation happens.

## 🚀 Just‑In‑Time (JIT) Compilation
**When:** At runtime, while the program is running.  
**How:**  
- Source code → (optional) intermediate bytecode → compiled to native machine code **on the fly**.  
- The runtime monitors execution, identifies “hot” code paths, and optimizes them dynamically.  

**Pros:**
- Adaptive optimization based on *actual* runtime behavior.
- Can inline, unroll, or specialize code for the current workload.
- Often faster than pure interpretation once warmed up.

**Cons:**
- Startup delay while code is compiled.
- Runtime overhead for profiling and compilation.
- Less time for deep optimizations compared to offline compilers.

**Examples:**  
Java HotSpot JVM, .NET CLR, V8 JavaScript engine.

## 🏗 Ahead‑Of‑Time (AOT) Compilation
**When:** Before the program runs (build time).  
**How:**  
- Source code → native machine code → shipped as an executable.  

**Pros:**
- No runtime compilation overhead → fast startup.
- Allows heavy, time‑consuming optimizations.
- Easier to deploy without requiring a runtime JIT.

**Cons:**
- No runtime profiling → optimizations are based on predictions, not actual usage.
- Less adaptable to changing workloads.

**Examples:**  
C, C++, Rust, Go.

## 📜 Interpretation
**When:** At runtime, line‑by‑line or statement‑by‑statement.  
**How:**  
- Source code (or bytecode) is read and executed directly by an interpreter.  

**Pros:**
- Immediate execution — great for scripting and rapid prototyping.
- Highly portable — just need the interpreter for the target platform.

**Cons:**
- Slower execution due to repeated parsing/translation.
- No persistent native code output.

**Examples:**  
Python (CPython), Ruby (MRI), Bash.

## 🔄 Hybrid Models
Some languages mix strategies:
- **Bytecode + JIT**: Java, C#, JavaScript (modern engines).
- **AOT + JIT**: .NET Native, GraalVM.
- **Interpreted + JIT**: Python with PyPy.
