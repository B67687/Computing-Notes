## 🧠 Signed Binary Representation via Radix Complements

For signed numbers in binary, since we want to represent them in 1's complement or 2's complement form, we always represent the **absolute value** of that number in either form.

The **sign** is fixed to be `0` or `1` to represent positive or negative.

## 🔁 1's Complement

We compute:

```
2^(n+1) - 1  MINUS  the binary number
```

This is a string of all 1s—same length as the binary number—minus the binary number itself.

```
11111...111
```

Because the differences between `1` and the `numbers in base 2` are:

```
1 - 1 = 0
1 - 0 = 1
```

The result is always the **bit-flipped version** of the original number, which is equivalent to the **NOT logical operation**.

Because `bit-flipping at MSB` also turns `positive sign` to `negative sign`
> We can disregard treating the magnitude part separately from the sign.

> [!note] Converting to Negative with Signed Bit
> Notice that `polarity change`——flipping from `positive` to `negative`——is only a feature because the number is expressed in `signed form`
>
> - It is an **optimisation** we make in **binary signed-forms** where the bits exactly represent 2 states——correlating with `positive` and `negative` for the **signed bit**
> - Thus we can directly take the `positive binary number` and convert it to its `negative complement form`
>
> Thus, this isn't an inherent property of complements, its just **hardware optimisation** for **binary signed-forms**

> [!tip] Reversal and Binary
> And because it is a `full number bitflip` , its `reversal` is also the same

## 🐬 Conversion Procedure
>
> [!example] 1's Complement Conversion—and Reversal
> Flip every bit of the number (including the sign bit)

## 🔁 2's Complement

Since 2's complement is `1` **more than 1's complement**:

We can simply
> Perform the 1's complement——flip every bit (including the sign bit)
> Add 1 to the result

### 🌊 Ripple Carry Optimisation

> Addition of `1` at the **LSB** causes a **ripple carry** that flips the string of `1`s from the **LSB** rightwards until it hits the first `0`

```
From ...0111...111
To   ...1000...000
```

Since we performed a **full number bitflip** in the first step

> All the bits that were **consecutive 0s from the LSB up to the first 1**, won't have `net change` because it would have:
>
> - **Bit flip the first time** to a string of 1s from LSB up to the first 0
> - **Bit flip back** to the string of 0s from LSB up to the first 1—when adding one.
>
> The **bits that are after the first 1**, will only have flipped once and thus will have net change——bit-flip

> [!Fun Fact] Permanent Bit
> Because succession——adding 1——is always a bitflip, the `LSB will always flip twice`, and therefore is the only bit that is always preserved in `2's complement conversions`

> [!tip] Reversal and Binary
> Because it is just `bitflips` , its `reversal` is also the same `bitflip`

## 🐬 Conversion Procedure

> [!example] 2's Complement Conversion—and Reversal
>
> 1. **Scan** from LSB toward MSB
> 2. **Preserve** all bits up to and including the first `1` encountered
   —**The LSB is always preserved**
> 3. **Flip all remaining bits** to the left (including the sign bit)

## 🧩 Philosophical Closure

Such simplicity arises from applying the **method of complements using radixes**, and then applying it to the design of signed binary values.

This isn't just a trick—it's a **compressed derivation** of modular arithmetic, polarity encoding, and hardware efficiency.
