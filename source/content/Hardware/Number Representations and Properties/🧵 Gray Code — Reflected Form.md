Gray code is a binary sequence where each successive number differs by only one bit. This is useful in digital systems to minimize transition errors. But how do we reliably construct such a sequence — especially one that wraps around cyclically?

Let’s explore this from first principles, building intuition as we go.

---

## 🧩 Starting Construction

We begin with the base case: binary numbers of 1 digit.

```
0
1
```

This trivially satisfies the Gray code condition — only one bit changes between the two.

---

## 🧱 Expanding to the Next Digit

To expand to the next digit, we must now consider both the `0` MSB case and the `1` MSB case.

### 🔹 The 0 MSB Case

This is straightforward. We can simply append a `0` to the front of each existing number:

```
0 + 0 → 00
0 + 1 → 01
```

This preserves the 1-bit change property between these two numbers.

---

## 🔹 Entering the 1 MSB Case

Now we want to construct the `1` MSB case. But we must ensure that the transition from the last number in the `0` MSB case to the first number in the `1` MSB case still changes only one bit.

Since the MSB is the one that changes (from `0` to `1`), we must ensure the **remaining bits do not change**. Thus, we keep the remaining bits from the **last binary number** within the `0` MSB case.

So if the last number in the `0` MSB case is `01`, then the first number in the `1` MSB case must be `11`.

This satisfies the 1-bit change requirement.

---

## 🔄 Preserving Transitions Within the 1 MSB Case

But we don’t just want the first transition to work — we want **all transitions** within the `1` MSB case to also change only one bit.

To do this, we realize that we can keep the remaining bits for the other numbers too — but read **backwards** from the last case to the first case in the `0` MSB case.

Why? Because 1-bit change not only happens forwards but also backwards.

So instead of:

```
1 + 0 → 10
1 + 1 → 11
```

We reverse the original sequence:

```
1 + 1 → 11
1 + 0 → 10
```

Now the full 2-bit Gray code is:

```
00
01
11
10
```

Each step changes only one bit. Even the transition from `10` back to `00` changes only the MSB — satisfying the **wraparound** condition.

---

## 🪞 Realization: This Is Just Reflection

We now realize that all of this is just an application of the **reversal** of the remaining bits within the previous cases.

This is the same as a **reflection**.

---

## 🔁 Wraparound Validity

Not only is this a reflection, but because the remaining bits of the last binary number match the remaining bits of the first binary number, they differ in only the MSB.

This means they differ in 1 bit — which satisfies Gray code again, achieving the **wraparound feature** as well.

---

## ✅ Final Construction Rule

Thus, a reliable way of generating Gray code with wraparound is:

> Simply reflect all the current binary numbers,
> Assign `0` to the MSB of the first set,
> Assign `1` to the MSB of the second set,
> And that's it.

This method guarantees:

- 1-bit transitions between all successive numbers
- Cyclic wraparound with only one bit change
- Recursive scalability
