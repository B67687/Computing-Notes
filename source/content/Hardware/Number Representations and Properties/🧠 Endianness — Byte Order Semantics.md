## 📘 Overview
Endianness defines how multi-byte data (e.g. 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit) is stored in memory. It determines the **byte order**—not digit order—used to represent values.

| Term           | Definition                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Big-endian** | Stores the Most Significant Value (MSV) first     |
| **Little-endian** | Stores the Least Significant Value (LSV) first

## 📚 Etymology & Semantic Ancestry

The term **"endian"** originates from **Jonathan Swift’s _Gulliver’s Travels_ (1726)**, where two factions—the *Big-Endians* and *Little-Endians*—argue over which end of a boiled egg to crack first. Swift used this absurd conflict to satirize religious and political disputes.

> Thus the word is `End-ian`

In **1980**, computer scientist **Danny Cohen** repurposed the metaphor in an Internet Experiment Note to describe byte-order disagreements between computer architectures. He coined:

- **Big-endian**: MSB-first systems
- **Little-endian**: LSB-first systems

> 🧠 *Semantic Flag*: The term is a rare example of literary satire becoming a technical standard.

## 🔍 Byte Layout Comparison

### Example: `0x12345678` (32-bit integer)

| Format        | Byte Sequence (Low → High Address) |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Big-endian    | `12 34 56 78`                       |
| Little-endian | `78 56 34 12`                       |

### Visual Anchor

```
Memory Address →   0x00   0x01   0x02   0x03
Big-endian     →   0x12   0x34   0x56   0x78
Little-endian  →   0x78   0x56   0x34   0x12
```

## 🧩 Semantic Flags

| Flag                     | Big-endian                          | Little-endian                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `#human-readable`        | ✅ Matches decimal notation          | ❌ Counterintuitive to humans        |
| `#network-standard`      | ✅ Used in TCP/IP, DNS, etc.         | ❌ Requires conversion               |
| `#arithmetic-efficiency` | ❌ Harder to start with LSB          | ✅ Easier for incremental ops        |
| `#sign-bit-access`       | ✅ MSB at lowest address             | ❌ MSB at highest address            |
| `#binary-comparison`     | ✅ Lexicographically aligned         | ❌ Needs reordering for MSB-first    |
| `#memory-fetch`          | ❌ No major advantage                | ✅ Historically faster on byte-wise CPUs |

## 🧭 Usage Contexts

### ✅ Big-endian Preferred
- **Network protocols**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP headers (`#network-standard`)
- **Binary formats**: JPEG, MPEG, EXIF (`#human-readable`)
- **Embedded systems**: Hex dumps for diagnostics (`#sign-bit-access`)

### ❌ Big-endian Avoided
- **x86/x64 systems**: Native little-endian architecture
- **Low-level arithmetic**: Harder to start from LSB (`#arithmetic-efficiency`)

---

### ✅ Little-endian Preferred
- **Intel/AMD CPUs**: Native format (`#memory-fetch`)
- **Arithmetic-heavy systems**: Easier overflow detection, addition (`#arithmetic-efficiency`)
- **Low-level debugging**: Easier to trace LSB-first logic

### ❌ Little-endian Avoided
- **Cross-platform communication**: Requires conversion to big-endian
- **Lexicographic sorting**: MSB-last complicates binary comparison

## 🧠 Motivation Analogy

Think of endianness like stacking books:

- **Big-endian**: Title page on top → easy to identify the book
- **Little-endian**: Index page on top → efficient if you're flipping from the back
