### üß† Motivation

> [!Why we invented this]
> Booth‚Äôs algorithm was designed to **optimize signed multiplication** in 2‚Äôs complement systems by reducing the number of additions and subtractions.
>
> In traditional binary multiplication, each `1` in the multiplier triggers an addition of the multiplicand. But long runs of `1`s (e.g. `1111`) cause redundant additions.
>
> Booth‚Äôs insight: **encode transitions** between bits to compress these operations.
>
> > Instead of reacting to every `1`, we react to **changes** between bits‚Äîturning a run of `1`s into a single subtraction followed by a series of shifts.
>
> This makes Booth‚Äôs algorithm ideal for hardware, where fewer arithmetic operations mean faster, cheaper computation.

## üîß Transition Encoding: The Core Trick

Let the multiplier be `Q`, and introduce an extra bit `Q‚Çã‚ÇÅ = 0`.

We scan the multiplier **bit-pair-wise**: `Q·µ¢ Q·µ¢‚Çã‚ÇÅ`

| Bit Pair | Action                  |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `10`     | Subtract multiplicand   |
| `01`     | Add multiplicand        |
| `00`/`11`| No operation            |

> [!Note]
> This transition encoding compresses runs of `1`s into a single operation, reducing the number of additions/subtractions.

## üßÆ Booth‚Äôs Multiplication Setup

Let:

- `A` = Accumulator (initially 0)
- `Q` = Multiplier
- `Q‚Çã‚ÇÅ` = Extra bit (initially 0)
- `M` = Multiplicand

We perform `n` cycles (where `n` is the bit-width), and in each cycle:

1. Check `Q‚ÇÄ Q‚Çã‚ÇÅ` ‚Üí decide operation
2. Add/Subtract `M` to/from `A`
3. Perform **arithmetic right shift** on `[A Q Q‚Çã‚ÇÅ]`

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Solves

> [!Success Criteria]
> ‚úÖ Handles signed numbers natively in 2‚Äôs complement
> ‚úÖ Reduces redundant additions for long runs of `1`s
> ‚úÖ Uses fewer arithmetic operations than na√Øve method
> ‚úÖ Preserves sign via arithmetic shifts
> ‚úÖ Avoids separate sign correction logic

## ‚ùå What It Complicates

> [!Tradeoffs]
> ‚ùå Requires bit-pair scanning logic
> ‚ùå Needs an extra bit (`Q‚Çã‚ÇÅ`) and accumulator
> ‚ùå Arithmetic shifts must preserve sign
> ‚ùå Final result must be interpreted carefully
> ‚ùå Not intuitive for human learners

## üßÆ Worked Example: 1011 √ó 1101

Let‚Äôs multiply `1011` (‚àí5) √ó `1101` (‚àí3) in 4-bit 2‚Äôs complement.

### Step 1: Initial Setup

```plaintext
M = 1011  (‚àí5)
Q = 1101  (‚àí3)
Q‚Çã‚ÇÅ = 0
A = 0000
```

### Step 2: Cycle Breakdown

|-------|--------|----------------|---------|---------|------|------------------------------|
| 1     | 1 0    | A = A ‚àí M      | 0101    | 1101    | 0    | Subtract M                  |
|       |        | Shift          | 0010    | 1110    | 1    | Arithmetic right shift      |
| 2     | 0 1    | A = A + M      | 1101    | 1110    | 1    | Add M                       |
|       |        | Shift          | 1110    | 1111    | 0    | Arithmetic right shift      |
| 3     | 1 0    | A = A ‚àí M      | 0101    | 1111    | 0    | Subtract M                  |
|       |        | Shift          | 0010    | 1111    | 1    | Arithmetic right shift      |
| 4     | 1 1    | No operation   | 0010    | 1111    | 1    | No op                       |
|       |        | Shift          | 0001    | 1111    | 1    | Final shift                 |

### Final Result: `00001111` ‚Üí **+15**

## üß† Vault Flag: Compression vs Comprehension

Booth‚Äôs algorithm is a **compression of signed multiplication logic**, not a conceptual foundation. It‚Äôs optimized for **hardware**, not for **human clarity**. For pedagogy, the magnitude-first method is superior.
