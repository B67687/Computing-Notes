## 🔍 Motivation

> Arithmetic overflow occurs when the result of an operation exceeds the representable range of a fixed-width binary system.  
> 
> It’s not a computational error—it’s a **representation mismatch** between the result and the available bit space.

Overflow is especially critical in **signed systems**, where the MSB encodes sign, and the range is asymmetric.

## 🧮 Representational Limits

| **Bit Width (n)** | **Unsigned Range** | **Signed (Two’s Complement)** |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| 4 bits            | 0 to 15            | −8 to +7                      |
| 8 bits            | 0 to 255           | −128 to +127                  |
| 16 bits           | 0 to 65,535        | −32,768 to +32,767            |

## ⚠️ Overflow Scenarios

### ✅ Valid Addition
```
  0101 (5)  
+ 0010 (2)  
-----------
= 0111 (7) ← within range
```
  
### ❌ Overflow: Positive + Positive → Negative
```
  0111 (+7)  
+ 0001 (+1)  
------------
= 1000 (−8) ← overflow!

```
  
### ❌ Overflow: Negative + Negative → Positive
```
  1011 (−5)  
+ 1010 (−6)  
------------
= 0101 (+5) ← overflow!

```

---

### ✅ Valid Subtraction
```
  00010101 (+21)  
− 00001111 (+15)  
-----------------
= 00000110 (+6) ← within range
```

### ❌ Overflow: Positive − Negative → Too Positive
```
  01111111 (+127)  
− 11111111 (−1)  
------------------
= 10000000 (−128) ← overflow!
```
  
### ❌ Overflow: Negative − Positive → Too Negative
```
  10000000 (−128)  
− 01111111 (+127)  
------------------
= 00000001 (+1) ← overflow!
```

## 🔧 Detection Logic

### 🧠 XOR Method (Addition Only)

Overflow occurs **iff**:  
Carry into MSB ≠ Carry out of MSB

Overflow = Cin ⊕ Cout

Where:
- Cin = carry into MSB
- Cout = carry out of MSB

This method is hardware-optimized and applies only to **addition**.

---

### 🧠 Sign Rule (Generalized)

| **Operation** | **Overflow Condition** |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Addition      | Operands have **same sign**, result has **different sign** |
| Subtraction   | Operands have **different signs**, result sign ≠ minuend sign |

This rule is semantic and works for both addition and subtraction.

## 🔁 Semantic Resonance: Overflow as Wraparound

Think of binary arithmetic as a **circular number line**:
- Adding beyond the max wraps around to the negative zone
- Subtracting below the min wraps around to the positive zone

This is a **modular artifact**, not a logical failure.

## 🧠 Vault Hooks

- **Audit Checklist**: Validate MSB transitions, operand signs, and result sign  
- **Overflow Map**: Diagram signed vs unsigned wraparound zones  
- **Teaching Analogy**: Overflow as “clock arithmetic” with sign flips  
- **Pipeline Module**: Embed XOR-based overflow detection for addition, and sign-rule logic for subtraction  
- **Semantic Validator**: Compare operand signs and result sign to flag representational collapse
