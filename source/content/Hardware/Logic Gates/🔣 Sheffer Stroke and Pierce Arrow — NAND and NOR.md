| Symbol | Operation | Formal Name | Expression |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| $$A \uparrow B$$ | NAND | Sheffer stroke | $$(A \land B)'$$ |
| $$A \downarrow B$$ | NOR | Peirce arrow | $$(A \lor B)'$$ |

- **Henry M. Sheffer** introduced $$\uparrow$$ in 1913 as a single primitive capable of expressing all Boolean logic.
- **Charles S. Peirce** explored $$\downarrow$$ earlier as a dual primitive.
- Both symbols represent **functionally complete** operations — each alone can construct all logical gates.

## 🏹 Reasons for Arrow Direction
The symbols chosen for visual and logical contrast, not physical necessity

## 🔼 NAND — Sheffer Stroke — *Strict, Upward, Energetic*
Based on **AND**, which requires **all inputs to be true** — a strict condition.

> [!tip] Motivation for Pointing Up
> The upward stroke $\uparrow$ symbolizes:
> - **Logical tension** — all conditions must be fulfilled
> - **Energetic lift** — negating strictness requires effort
> - **Constraint-breaking** — NAND lifts out of grounded certainty
>
> NAND points up because it negates a strict, high-effort condition — it follows from the rigidity of AND, in the complement way

## 🔽 NOR — Peirce Arrow — *Loose, Downward, Grounded*
Based on **OR**, which accepts **any input being true** — a loose condition.

> [!tip] Motivation for Pointing Down
> The downward arrow $\downarrow$ symbolizes:
> - **Logical ease** — minimal fulfillment suffices
> - **Grounded collapse** — negating looseness returns to constraint
> - **Down-to-earth minimalism** — NOR flattens possibility
>
> NOR points down because it negates a loose, low-effort condition — it follows from the openness of OR, in the complement way
