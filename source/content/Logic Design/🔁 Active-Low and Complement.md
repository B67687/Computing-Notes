In digital systems, signals often carry meaning not just through their value (0 or 1), but through *how* that value is interpreted. This note distinguishes **active-low signals** from **complemented expressions**, which are often conflated but serve different semantic roles.

### âš¡ Active-Low Signals

- **Definition**: A signal is *active-low* if its intended action or assertion occurs when the signal is `0`.
- **Notation**: Often denoted with a bar (e.g. $\overline{\text{RESET}}$) or suffix `_n`, `_bar`, `_b` (e.g. `reset_n`, `enable_b`).
- **Interpretation**:
  - `reset_n = 0` â†’ reset is *active*
  - `reset_n = 1` â†’ reset is *inactive*

- **Use Case**: Common in hardware due to transistor behavior (e.g. NMOS pulls low more easily), and noise immunity (low signals are less likely to be corrupted).

### ðŸ”„ Complemented Expressions

- **Definition**: A complement is the logical inverse of a signal or expression.
- **Notation**: Typically written as `!A`, `~A`, or $\overline{A}$.
- **Interpretation**:
  - If `A = 1`, then `~A = 0`
  - If `A = 0`, then `~A = 1`

- **Use Case**: Used in logic expressions, truth tables, and Boolean simplification.

### ðŸ§© Key Difference

| Concept              | Trigger Value | Semantic Meaning         | Example             |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Active-Low Signal**| `0`           | Action is *asserted*      | `reset_n = 0 â†’ reset active` |
| **Complement**       | `1`           | Expression is *true*      | `~A = 1 â†’ A was 0`  |

- **Active-low** is about *how a signal is interpreted* in a system.
- **Complement** is about *logical inversion* of a value or expression.

### ðŸ§  Analogy

Think of **active-low** as a doorbell that rings when *not pressed* â€” the system is designed to respond to a low signal.

Think of **complement** as flipping a switch â€” itâ€™s just the inverse of whatever state you started with.
