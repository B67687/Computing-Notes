Any system has `inputs` and `outputs`, and can have outputs that represent `ON` or `OFF` states

Our goal is to derive Boolean expression(s) that fully reflects the relationship between the `inputs` of a system to its active states——`ON` or `OFF`

---

## ☯️ ON and OFF States

A function’s output is either **ON** or **OFF**

> [!tip] Defining a System
> We can represent the system through
> - All input combinations that turn it **ON**
> - Or all combinations that turn it **OFF**

Defining one automatically defines the other—this is the [[Principle of Duality]]  

We only need to choose one side to work with.

## 🔌Importance of Active States

When designing systems that has active states——`ON` and `OFF`——we have to determine which **state we want to focus on** that will **represent the behaviour of the system**
> As the same system cannot be represented by both `ON` and `OFF` at the same time
> 
> They must be **represented separately**

For us, we would prefer to think of **existence** as a more meaningful and important state than **non-existence**

So we will focus on which what represents existence——`ON`——to represent systems with active states

---

## 💈Strictness of Active States

We also prefer to have the state that we care about——`ON`——to have a stricter condition

This is such that we can **control exactly** which **combinations of inputs** in our systems will definitely **lead to its activation**

In the same vein, `OFF` will be treated as the more lenient condition

---

## 📐Activation in Binary

The binary numbers picked for activation is also reflected as what we prefer to be active, where `1` represents `High Electrical Signal` and `0` represents `Low Electrical Signal`

The convention used for representing activation states is also called [[⚡ Active-High and Active-Low | Active High]]

---

## 🧱 Representation of Each Input Combination by Active State

All the states of a system can be listed out in what we call a [[🧠 Truth Tables — Boolean Logic | Truth Table]]

| A | B | C | F |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Each row of such a table contains a **unique input combination** of the system——`A`,`B`,`C` in this case——that relates to its corresponding **output**——either `1` representing `ON` or `0` representing `OFF`

> [!info] Strictness of Combinations
> Thus each `ON` state of the system can be represented by **strict combination of all its corresponding inputs**
> 
> And each `OFF` state of the system can be represented by **lenient combination of all its corresponding inputs**

These concepts will be coined and explained in further detail in the below sub-sections

---

## 🔹 Minterm
The **strict combination of all the corresponding inputs** that causes the output to have an `ON` state, is called a `Minterm`

> [!info] Etymology
> It is also the **minimum combination-of-inputs condition** for the system to be considered `ON`
>
> Thus, the **term** representing such a combination of inputs is called the **Minimum Term** 
> 
> Or the `Minterm`

**Strictness** is represented by the `AND` operator, so its inputs will be `AND-ed` to represent the `ON` state

Since `AND` requires all its inputs to be `True` for the `AND` expression to be `True`, the inputs that are `0` in that row are represented through the `complement` of that input variable

> [!example]
> For $A=1$, $B=0$, $C=1$, the minterm is:  
> $$A \cdot B' \cdot C$$  
> This is only true when A is `True`, B is `False`, and C is `True`

---

## 🔸 Maxterm

The **lenient combination of all the corresponding inputs** that causes the output to have an `OFF` state, is called a `Maxterm`

> [!info] Etymology
> It is also the **maximum combination-of-inputs condition** for the system to be considered `OFF`
>
> Thus, the **term** representing such a combination of inputs is called the **Maximum Term** 
> 
> Or the `Maxterm`

**Lenience** is represented by the `OR` operator, so its inputs will be `OR-ed` to represent the `OFF` state

Since `OR` requires none of its inputs to be `True` for the `OR` expression to be `False`, the inputs that are `1` in that row are represented through the `complement` of that input variable

> [!example]
> For $A=1$, $B=0$, $C=1$, the maxterm is:  
> $$A' + B + C'$$  
> This is only false when A is `True`, B is `False`, and C is `True`

---

## 🧮 Representation of the System by Active State

Now that we have an expression representing each `ON` state of the system through the **strict combination of all its corresponding inputs**——the `minterm`

And also an expression representing each `OFF` state of the system through the **lenient combination of all its corresponding inputs**——the `maxterm`

We can represent the system itself through the **combinations of all of either**
> the expressions representing the `ON` states of the system——`minterms`
>
> OR
>
> the expressions representing the `OFF` states of the system——`maxterms`

> [!tip] The System Represented Through `ON` States
> Since each separate condition for the `ON` state is `strict`, we only **need either of them** for the whole system to be `ON`
> 
> > Thus, the representation of the system through all the `ON` states is `lenient`

> [!tip] The System Represented Through `OFF` States
> Since each separate condition for the `OFF` state is `lenient`, we must **exclude all of them** for the whole system to be `OFF`
> 
> > Thus, the representation of the system through all the `OFF` states is `strict`

These concepts will be coined and explained in further detail in the below sub-sections

## ➕ Sum of Minterms

The system represented by `ON` state, through the **lenient combination** of **minterms**, is called the `Sum of Minterms`

It is named so because a **lenient combination** is what `OR` represents, which written out in [[🧮 Boolean Algebra | Boolean Algebraic Form]] uses the `+` sign to represent `OR`

Take the same Truth Table shown earlier

| A | B | C | F |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

The `Sum of Minterms` will be represented and calculated like this

$$
\begin{align}
F(A, B, C) &= \sum m(1,3,4,6,8) \\ 
&= m_1 + m_3 + m_4 + m_6 + m_8 \\
&= A'B'C' + A'BC' + A'BC + AB'C + ABC
\end{align}
$$

> This is read as:
>
> The general function, `F`, with input variables, `A`,`B`,`C`, is the sum, `Σ`, of minterms, `m`, in rows `1`,`3`,`4`,`6`,`8`
 
This **full exhaustive form** is known as the **Canonical Form**, as it contains all the **terms** that contain all the **input variables**

This expression is thus more aptly known as the `Sum of Products`, or `SOP` for short
> [!Warning]
> Take note that *Sum* here is **NOT the arithmetic sum** used in Maths, but a **borrowed symbol** to represent `OR` in Logic
> 
> The **structural similarity** between logical `OR` and arithmetic sum——such as *associativity*, *commutativity*, and *distributivity*——is why the symbol was borrowed

Any further simplification of `Sum of Products` can be done through an optimised method, leveraging visualisation, called [[🗺️ Karnaugh Maps | Karnaugh Maps]]

## ✖️ Product of Maxterms

The system represented by `OFF` state, through the **strict combination** of **maxterms**, is called the `Product of Maxterms`

It is named so because a **strict combination** is what `AND` represents, which written out in [[🧮 Boolean Algebra | Boolean Algebraic Form]] uses the `⋅` sign to represent `AND`

Take the same Truth Table shown earlier

| A | B | C | F |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

The `Product of Maxterms` will be represented and calculated like this

$$
\begin{align}
F(A, B, C) &= \prod M(2,5,7) \\ 
&= M_2 \cdot M_5 \cdot M_7 \\
&= (A + B + C') \cdot (A + B' + C) \cdot (A' + B + C)
\end{align}
$$

> This is read as:
> 
> The general function, `F`, with input variables, `A`,`B`,`C`, is the product, `Π`, of maxterms, `M`, in rows `2`,`5`,`7`

This **full exhaustive form** is known as the **Canonical Form**, as it contains all the **terms** that contain all the **input variables**

This expression is thus more aptly known as the `Product of Sums`, or `POS` for short
> [!Warning]
> Take note that *Product* here is **NOT the arithmetic product** used in Maths, but a **borrowed symbol** to represent `AND` in Logic 
>
> The **structural similarity** between logical `AND` and arithmetic product——such as *associativity*, *commutativity*, and *distributivity*——is why the symbol was borrowed

## ⚖️ De Morgan Laws

Both `SOP` and `POS` represent the same function—just from opposite perspectives.

> [!info] **De Morgan’s Laws**
> De Morgan's Laws allow us to interchange `AND`/`OR` operations transform between `SOP` and `POS`
>
> $$(A \cdot B)' = A' + B'$$  
> $$(A + B) = A' \cdot B'$$
