Flowcharts are graphical representations of processes, algorithms, or systems using standardized symbols. They help visualize control flow, decision points, and execution paths in a way that bridges both technical logic and user-facing interaction.

## ðŸ”¹ Core Purpose

- Clarify the structure and logic of algorithms  
- Aid in debugging, optimization, and documentation  
- Communicate processes across technical and non-technical audiences  
- Separate internal computation from external interaction

## ðŸ§± Basic Symbols

| Symbol        | Meaning                  | Shape Description | Semantic Role |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| â¬¬ `Terminal`  | Start / End              | Rounded rectangle | Entry or exit point of the flow<br>- Good to be explicit than to be implicit |
| â¬œ `Process`   | Internal computation or transformation | Rectangle | Represents logic, operations, or function calls |
| ðŸ”· `Decision`  | Conditional branching    | Diamond           | Evaluates conditions to direct flow<br>(True/False) |
| ðŸŸ¦ `Input/Output` | External interaction | Parallelogram     | Represents user â†” system data exchange |
| âž¡ `Arrow`     | Flow of control          | Directed line     | Indicates execution sequence |

> [!note] ðŸ§  Note:  
> `Process` blocks handle internal logic (e.g., calculations, function calls)
> 
> `Input/Output` blocks represent conceptual interfacesâ€”such as user input or system outputâ€”not return values or internal data flow.

## ðŸ”€ Control Constructs

| Construct   | Description | Flowchart Representation |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Sequence** | Linear execution of steps | â¬œ â†’ â¬œ â†’ â¬œ |
| **Branching** | Conditional logic (if/else) | ðŸ”· â†’ [Yes] / [No] paths |
| **Looping**   | Repetition based on condition | ðŸ”· â†’ â¬œ â†’ ðŸ”· (cycle) |

## ðŸ§ª Example: Fever Check Logic

```plaintext
â¬¬ Start
   â†“
ðŸŸ¦ Input: Enter temperature
   â†“
â¬œ Process: Compare with 37.5
   â†“
ðŸ”· Decision: Temp â‰¥ 37.5?
   â†™           â†˜
ðŸŸ¦ Output: Fever   ðŸŸ¦ Output: Normal
   â†“               â†“
â¬¬ End           â¬¬ End
```

## ðŸ§° Tips for Designing Flowcharts

- âœ… Keep symbols consistent and clearly labeled  
- âœ… Use directional arrows to guide logical flow  
- âœ… Avoid crossing linesâ€”use connectors or off-page references  
- âœ… Modularize complex logic into sub-flowcharts or linked diagrams  
- âœ… Align elements for visual clarity and cognitive ease  
- âœ… Use color or emoji sparingly to highlight key paths or decisions

- System workflows and process automation  
- Business process modeling  
- Educational logic mapping and teaching aids  
- Decision support systems
