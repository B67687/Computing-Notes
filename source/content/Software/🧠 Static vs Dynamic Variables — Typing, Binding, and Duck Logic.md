Understanding how variables behave‚Äîhow they're typed, bound, and interpreted‚Äîis key to mastering programming paradigms. This note explores **static vs dynamic typing**, **variable binding**, and the philosophy of **duck typing**.

## üß© What Is Variable Typing?

> Typing refers to how a variable‚Äôs **data type** is determined, enforced, and checked.

| Typing Mode | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Static Typing** | Type is known and checked at **compile time** |
| **Dynamic Typing** | Type is determined at **runtime**, based on actual value |

## üß± Static Typing

```text
int x = 5
x = "hello"  ‚ùå Compile-time error
```
- ‚úÖ Type is declared explicitly (`int`, `float`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Errors are caught early by the compiler
- ‚úÖ IDEs offer better autocomplete and refactoring
- ‚ùå Less flexible for generic or polymorphic code

üß† Languages: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go

---

## üîÑ Dynamic Typing

```text
x = 5
x = "hello"  ‚úÖ Allowed
```

- ‚úÖ No need to declare types  
- ‚úÖ Flexible and concise  
- ‚ùå Type errors only show up at runtime  
- ‚ùå Harder to optimize or refactor

üß† Languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Lua

## ü¶Ü Duck Typing ‚Äî Behavior Over Type

> ‚ÄúIf it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it‚Äôs a duck.‚Äù

Duck typing is a **dynamic typing philosophy** where the **object‚Äôs behavior** matters more than its declared type.

```python
def quack_and_walk(thing):
    thing.quack()
    thing.walk()
```
- ‚úÖ No need to check `type(thing)`  
- ‚úÖ As long as `thing` has `quack()` and `walk()`, it works  
- ‚ùå May cause runtime errors if methods are missing

üß† Emphasizes **interface by behavior**, not inheritance or type declaration.

## üß† Variable Binding ‚Äî Static vs Dynamic

| Binding Type       | Description                                      | Example                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Static Binding** | Variable type and method calls resolved at compile time | `int x = 5; x.toString()`     |
| **Dynamic Binding**| Resolved at runtime based on actual object       | `x = "hello"; x.upper()`       |

| Feature            | Static Typing        | Dynamic Typing        |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Type Known At      | Compile Time         | Runtime                |
| Flexibility        | Low                  | High                   |
| Error Detection    | Early                | Late                   |
| Performance        | Optimized            | Slower (potentially)   |
| Duck Typing        | ‚ùå Not applicable     | ‚úÖ Core philosophy      |
| Language Examples  | C, Java, Rust        | Python, JS, Ruby       |
