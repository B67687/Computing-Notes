## üìò Overview

**Closure** refers to a property of a set under a specific operation:  
> A set is *closed* under an operation if applying that operation to elements of the set **always produces an element still in the set**.

Closure is foundational to algebra, number theory, logic, and audit systems‚Äîit ensures **internal consistency** and **predictable behavior**.

## üß† Formal Definition

Let $S$ be a set and $\ast$ be a binary operation.  
Then $S$ is **closed under $\ast$** if:

$$
\forall a, b \in S,\; a \ast b \in S
$$

## üß© Examples of Closure

| Set            | Operation     | Closed? | Reason |
|----------------|---------------|---------|--------|
| $\mathbb{Z}$ (integers) | Addition       | ‚úÖ      | $a + b \in \mathbb{Z}$ |
| $\mathbb{Z}$            | Division       | ‚ùå      | $1 \div 2 = 0.5 \notin \mathbb{Z}$ |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ (rationals)| Addition       | ‚úÖ      | Sum of fractions is rational |
| $\mathbb{Q}$            | Multiplication | ‚úÖ      | Product of fractions is rational |
| $\mathbb{R}$ (reals)    | Exponentiation | ‚ùå      | $(-1)^{\sqrt{2}}$ is undefined in $\mathbb{R}$ |

## üîç Closure vs Non-Closure

### ‚úÖ Closed:
- $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition: $3 + 5 = 8$
- $\mathbb{Q}$ under multiplication: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$

### ‚ùå Not Closed:
- $\mathbb{Z}$ under division: $1 \div 2 = 0.5 \notin \mathbb{Z}$
- $\mathbb{R}$ under exponentiation: $(-1)^{\sqrt{2}}$ is complex

## üß† Why Closure Matters

- **Predictability**: Ensures operations stay within the system
- **Auditability**: Prevents semantic leakage across domains
- **Modularity**: Enables compositional reasoning
- **Security**: In cryptography, closure ensures key operations remain valid

## üß© Semantic Flags

- `#closure-addition`: Tracks additive closure
- `#closure-multiplication`: Tracks multiplicative closure
- `#closure-failure`: Flags operations that break closure
- `#audit-closure`: Used in logic and number theory modules
