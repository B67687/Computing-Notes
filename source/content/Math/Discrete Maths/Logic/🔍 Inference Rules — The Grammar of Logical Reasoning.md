## üìò Overview

Inference rules are the **formal templates** that govern how valid conclusions are derived from known premises. They form the **syntactic backbone** of mathematical proofs, logical arguments, and audit logic systems. Each rule defines a **structurally sound transformation**, ensuring that truth is preserved from input to output.

## üß† Structural Principle

> Inference rules operate **independently** of the content of the statements.  
> They apply to **logical form**, not semantic meaning.

This modularity makes them ideal for:
- Proof construction
- Predicate logic evaluation
- Programming and AI reasoning
- Ethical and legal audit frameworks

## üß© Categories of Inference Rules

### 1. **Propositional Logic Rules**

These work with **whole statements** (propositions) and logical connectives.

| Rule Name                                                | Form                                                         | Semantic Flag                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modus Ponens<br><br>`(Implication Elimation)`            | If $p \rightarrow q$ and $p$, then $q$                          | `Direct Implication`                                           |
| Modus Tollens<br><br>`(Contrapositive)`                  | If $p \rightarrow q$ and $\neg q$, then $\neg p$                 | `If the conclusion is not true, the precondition didnt happen` |
| Hypothetical Syllogism<br><br>`(Chain Reasoning)`        | If $p \rightarrow q$ and $q \rightarrow r$, then $p \rightarrow r$ | `Transitive Property`                                          |
| Disjunctive Syllogism<br><br>`(Conjunctive Elimination)` | If $p \lor q$ and $\neg p$, then $q$                           | `Eliminate the already false in an OR statement`               |
| Conjunction<br><br>`(Conjunctive Introduction)`          | If $p$ and $q$, then $p \land q$                               | `Combine Truths`                                               |
| Simplification<br><br>`(Conjunctive Elimination)`        | If $p \land q$, then $p$                                       | `Eliminate the already true in an AND statement`              |
| Addition<br><br>`(Disjunctive Introduction)`             | If $p$, then $p \lor q$                                        | `Add any other condition, as one is already True`              |

### 2. **Predicate Logic Rules**

These extend propositional rules to include **quantifiers** and **variables**.

| Rule Name                   | Form                                         | Semantic Flag       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Universal Instantiation     | From $\forall x,\;P(x)$ infer $P(a)$         | `#quantifier-unpack` |
| Existential Instantiation   | From $\exists x,\;P(x)$ infer $P(a)$ (with scope) | `#quantifier-unpack` |
| Universal Generalization    | From $P(x)$ for arbitrary $x$, infer $\forall x,\;P(x)$ | `#quantifier-pack` |
| Existential Generalization  | From $P(a)$, infer $\exists x,\;P(x)$        | `#quantifier-pack` |

> üîç Predicate rules require careful handling of variable scope and instantiation.

## üß™ Audit Examples

### Modus Ponens:
- Premises:  
  - $p$: "It is raining"  
  - $p \rightarrow q$: "If it is raining, the ground is wet"
- Conclusion:  
  - $q$: "The ground is wet"

### Disjunctive Syllogism:
- Premises:  
  - $p \lor q$: "It is either raining or sunny"  
  - $\neg p$: "It is not raining"
- Conclusion:  
  - $q$: "It is sunny"

## üß† Why Inference Rules Matter

- **Soundness**: Guarantees that conclusions are valid if premises are true
- **Modularity**: Enables chaining, nesting, and audit tracing
- **Teachability**: Each rule is a reusable pattern for reasoning
- **Cross-domain utility**: Applies to logic, ethics, programming, and law
