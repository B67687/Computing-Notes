### 🧠 What Does $A \equiv B \pmod{n}$ Really Mean?

It’s meant to be read like a sentence:
> "$A$ is congruent to $B$ modulo $n$"

But visually, it looks like:
> "$A$ is congruent to ($B \mod n$)"

Which is misleading. The actual meaning is:

$$
\underline{\phantom{\big)} A \space \text{mod} \space n \phantom{\big)}} = \underline{\phantom{\big)} B \space \text{mod} \space n \phantom{\big)}}
$$

This implies:

$$
A - B = kn \quad \text{for some integer } k
$$

### 🧩 Euclidean Form Interpretation

Every integer can be expressed as:
$$
A = qd + r \quad \text{and} \quad B = pd + r
$$

If $A$ and $B$ share the same remainder $r$ under division by $d$, then:

- Their difference is a multiple of $d$:
  $A - B = (q - p)d$
- Only the quotient varies; the remainder is fixed.

---

### 📉 Reliable Modulo Check

To test if $A \equiv B \pmod{n}$:

- ✅ Check if $(A - B) \mod n = 0$
- Faster than computing both remainders separately
- Conceptually: congruent numbers differ by full groups of $n$

### 🤔 Notation Rant: Why It’s Flawed

#### ❌ Conventional Form

- $A \equiv B \pmod{n}$ looks like:
  > "$A$ is congruent to ($B \space \text{mod} \space n$)"
  …which is not the intended meaning.

#### ✅ Proposed Alternatives

- **Language-first**:
  > “In mod $n$, $A$ is congruent to $B$”

- **Compact notation**:
  > $(A \equiv B)_{\text{mod }n}$
  …makes the scope of congruence explicit and extensible.

#### ⚠️ Ambiguity Warning

- Triple equals `≡` is reused in triangle congruence and other domains.
- Context is required to disambiguate.

### 🔍 Modulo and Small Numbers

If $|A| < n$:

- $A$ is the remainder itself:
  $A \mod n = A$

---

### ➖ Negative Division and Overcounting

Modulo prefers **overcounting** (floor division) for negative numbers:

- Ensures one-to-one mapping
- Keeps remainder in range: $0 \le r < n$
- Conceptually: overcounting is the opposite of undercounting, just like negative is the opposite of positive

---

### ➕ Modulo and Addition

- $(a \space \text{mod} \space n + b \space \text{mod} \space n) \mod n = (a + b) \mod n$
- Modulo is **closed** under addition, subtraction, multiplication
- The operation always wraps back to mod $n$

> You can think of modulo as a remainder-preserving transformation across operations.

### 🧠 Final Insight

Modular congruence is a way to classify integers by their **remainders** under a fixed divisor. All integers of the form $qn + r$ are congruent modulo $n$ if they share the same $r$.

> “Modulo is not just a remainder function—it’s a remainder **equivalence class**.”
