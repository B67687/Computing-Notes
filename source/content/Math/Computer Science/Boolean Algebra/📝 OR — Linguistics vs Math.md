When we use the word "or" in everyday language, we often mean "one or the other, but not both." 

This is called **exclusive OR** (`XOR`)

For example:

- "You can have coffee or tea." (Usually implies you can't have both).
- "Are you going to the park or the mall?" (You can't go to both at the same time).

### ðŸ’¡ The Logic of Inclusive OR

In mathematics, computer science, and logic, the term `OR` by itself, always means **inclusive OR**
> It means "A, or B, or both."

Think of it this way:

> `A OR B` is `TRUE` if:
 > - A is `TRUE`
 > - B is `TRUE`
 > - **BOTH** A and B are TRUE

This is precisely why the absorption law holds true. 

The expression $A \lor (A \land B)$ is true whenever $A$ is true. 

The additional term $A \land B$ doesn't add any new conditions for the overall statement to be true because if $A \land B$ is true, then A must already be true.

> [!NOTE] The absorption law is a fundamental concept in Boolean algebra, demonstrating that a compound term is redundant if one of its components is already present in a simpler form.

### ðŸ“š Visualizing with Sets

The same principle applies directly to set theory, where:

- Inclusive OR ($\lor$) is the **Union** ($\cup$)
- AND ($\land$) is the **Intersection** ($\cap$)

The law $A \cup (A \cap B) = A$ makes perfect sense because the intersection $A \cap B$ is always fully contained within the set $A$

Taking the union of $A$ with a part of itself will always just result in $A$

> [!IMPORTANT] Always assume "OR" is inclusive in a logical or mathematical context unless it is explicitly specified as exclusive OR. This simple rule prevents many common logical mistakes.
