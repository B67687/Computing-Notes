## 🔍 Motivation
In Boolean algebra, negating a compound expression like `cd` or `c + d` does **not** behave like arithmetic negation. Misapplying intuition from normal algebra leads to incorrect simplifications and faulty logic. This noteblock flags the distinction and anchors the correct approach using **De Morgan’s laws**.

## ❌ Common Misconception
Assuming:
- `c'd'` is the complement of `cd`
- `c'd' + cd = 1`

This is **false**. `c'd'` is only one of **three** cases where `cd = 0`. The full complement of `cd` is:

```
(cd)' = c' + d'
```


So:
- `c'd' ≠ (cd)'`
- `c'd' + cd ≠ 1`

## ✅ De Morgan’s Laws (Boolean Negation Rules)

| Original Expression | Boolean Negation        | Notes                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `(A · B)`           | `A' + B'`               | AND becomes OR                |
| `(A + B)`           | `A' · B'`               | OR becomes AND                |
| `(cd)'`             | `c' + d'`               | Not just `c'd'`               |
| `(c + d)'`          | `c'd'`                  | Only true when both are 0     |

## 🧠 Semantic Flags

- **Minterm ≠ Complement**: A single minterm like `c'd'` is a **slice**, not a full negation.
- **Complement covers all counter-cases**: `(cd)'` includes `c'd'`, `c'd`, and `cd'`.
- **Negation flips operators**: AND ↔ OR, not just variable signs.

## 🧪 Example Audit

Expression:

```
abc'd' + abcd + abcd'
```


Incorrect simplification:

```
= ab (c'd' + cd + cd') → ab
```


Correct simplification:

```
= ab (c'd' + cd + cd') = ab (c + d')
```


Why? Because:
- `cd + cd' = c`
- `c'd' + c = c + d'` ← via distributive identity

---

## 🧩 Teaching Tip

Use K-map tiles or truth tables to visualize how `c'd'` only covers one quadrant of the `cd` space. The full complement `(cd)'` spans three quadrants—this helps learners see why Boolean negation demands **structural** rather than **symbolic** thinking.

---

## 📌 Summary

- Always apply De Morgan’s laws when negating compound Boolean expressions.
- Never treat a single minterm as the full complement of a product.
- Boolean negation flips operators and expands coverage—not just signs.
