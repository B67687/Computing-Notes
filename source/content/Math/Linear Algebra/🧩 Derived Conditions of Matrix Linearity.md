Once we accept that linearity in matrices requires:

- **Positional integrity**: each entry must remain anchored to its row and column  
- **Proportional scaling**: all entries must scale uniformly, preserving internal ratios

Then several **derived conditions** naturally emerge:

---

### 📐 Shape Preservation

> Matrices must be of the **same shape** to be added or scaled  
> → Ensures positional alignment across all entries

$$
A, B \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \quad\Rightarrow\quad A + B \text{ is defined}
$$

---

### ➕ Closure Under Addition

> The sum of two matrices in the same space remains in that space  
> → Ensures that linear combinations stay within the same abstraction

$$
A, B \in V \quad\Rightarrow\quad A + B \in V
$$

---

### 🔁 Homogeneity

> Scaling a matrix by a scalar scales the output uniformly  
> → Preserves proportional relationships

$$
f(kA) = kf(A)
$$

---

### ➕ Additivity

> The transformation of a sum equals the sum of transformations  
> → Preserves superposition logic

$$
f(A + B) = f(A) + f(B)
$$

> [!note] Semantic Origin  
> These conditions are **not independent axioms**—they are **logical consequences** of preserving both **position** and **proportion** in matrix operations.
