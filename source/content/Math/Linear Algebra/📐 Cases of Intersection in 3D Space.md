## Case 0: ❌ No Common Intersection
- Two planes intersect in a line, but the third is parallel and does not intersect.
- Or all three planes are parallel but not coincident.
- Result: **No solution** to the system of equations.

## Case 1: 🎯 Unique Point of Intersection
- Two planes must be nonparallel and intersect in a line.
- The third plane must be nonparallel to that line and intersect it at a single point.
- Result: **Exactly one solution** — the point where all three planes meet.

## Case 2: 📏 Intersection Along a Line
- Each pair of planes intersects in a line.
- All three planes share **exactly one common line**.
- Result: **Infinitely many solutions** along that line.

## Case 3: 🪞 Coincident Planes
- All three planes are the same (fully overlapping).
- Every point on the plane satisfies all three equations.
- Result: **Infinitely many solutions** filling the entire plane.
