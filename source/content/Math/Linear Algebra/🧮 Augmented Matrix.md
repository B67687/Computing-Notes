In linear algebra, when solving systems of equations, we often represent the system using a **matrix**. But when we include the constants from the right-hand side of the equations, we form an **augmented matrix**.

## 🔍 What Is an Augmented Matrix?

An **augmented matrix** is a regular **coefficient matrix** that has been **extended** (augmented) with an extra column containing the constants from the equations.

### ✏️ Example System

$$
\begin{align}
2x + 3y &= 5 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{align}
$$

### 🧱 Coefficient Matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### ➕ Augmented Matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 & \vert & 5 \\
1 & -1 & \vert & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The last column (after the vertical bar) contains the constants from the right-hand side of the equations.

## 🧠 Semantic Motivation

| Term              | Includes RHS? | Purpose                          |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Matrix            | ❌ No          | Represents transformation        |
| Augmented Matrix  | ✅ Yes         | Represents full equation system  |

- "Matrix” refers to the **linear transformation** part ($Ax$).
- “Augmented matrix” includes the **entire system** ($Ax = b$).

> [!tip]
> The augmentation is what allows us to **solve** the system, not just analyze the transformation.

## 🧠 Why Not Just Call It “Full Matrix”?

Because linear algebra is about **precision**:
- “Matrix” = structure of coefficients
- “Augmented matrix” = structure + constraints

This distinction becomes critical when:
- Performing row reduction (Gaussian elimination)
- Checking consistency (e.g., rank comparison)
- Interpreting solution sets (e.g., null space vs full solution)

| Concept            | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Matrix             | Coefficients only ($A$)                          |
| Augmented Matrix   | Coefficients + RHS constants ($[A \vert b]$)     |
| Purpose            | Solve $Ax = b$ using row operations              |
